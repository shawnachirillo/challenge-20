# ðŸš€ Challenge 20: Testing

## Overview

This project demonstrates a fully operational CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions**, **Cypress**, and **Render**. It showcases a professional workflow that runs component tests on every pull request and automatically deploys the application when updates are merged into the `main` branch.

## Key Features

- âœ… **Cypress Component Tests** run on PRs to `develop`
- âœ… **Deployment to Render** when `main` is updated
- âœ… Written in **TypeScript** using Node.js + Express backend
- âœ… React frontend scaffolded with Vite
- âœ… GitHub Actions automation using two separate workflows

## CI/CD Workflow

### Cypress Workflow
- Triggered when a **pull request is made to `develop`**
- Runs `npx cypress run --component`
- Fails the PR if tests do not pass

### Deploy Workflow
- Triggered when changes are **pushed or merged to `main`**
- Calls a **Render Deploy Hook URL** via `curl`
- Ensures the production app stays up-to-date automatically
